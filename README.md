# USACO Algorithms

Repository for storing my code while I learn algorithms for USACO

## How the repo is structured

In each (capitalized) algorithm folder, theres a `link.txt` file and a `problems/` directory with a `problem.txt` file that starts with a link to the problem with copy of the problem in plaintext, and there are sub-folders with the shortened names for the practice problems. The problems are given by the [USACO.train website](https://usaco.train).
